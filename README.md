## Problem Description:

Individuals who have long-term medical conditions, like diabetes, may find it difficult to control how
much medication they take; this is particularly true for older people who may find it difficult to provide
insulin doses on time. This makes it vital to find a solution that deals with the problem of medication
management, guaranteeing that people with ongoing health difficulties receive timely reminders and
have access to their prescribed prescriptions.

## Problem Domain:

The aged and people with chronic health conditions are the focus of this problem domain. With the
use of a subscription-based business model, it seeks to offer a service that guarantees the availability of
pharmacy items, expedites the delivery of medications, and sends timely reminders for medication
ingestion. For those with long-term health issues such as diabetes, asthma, and other illnesses, the goal
is to improve drug adherence and general health maintenance.

## Project Objective:

The main goal of the project is to create a comprehensive mobile application that functions as a
platform for health management. Through a subscription service, this application will enable users to
receive regular reminders for taking their medications, expedite the delivery of medications and
pharmacy products, and offer recommendations forrelated medications in an emergency. The project
also intends to provide helpful health advice for common health conditions, with a focus on Ayurveda.
Moreover, the integration of captivating elements such as games pertaining to health aims to establish a
comprehensive strategy for upholding a healthy way of life.
